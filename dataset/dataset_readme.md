# Prompt 1

Got it ✅ — you want **Option 1 (RAG with LLaMA)** but with a twist:

* If the question is **domain-related (SQL/NoSQL)** and answerable from your 10k-row dataset → chatbot should pull from dataset.
* If the question is **domain-related but not covered in dataset** → chatbot should still answer using its **base LLaMA knowledge** (without hallucination).
* If the question is **not domain-related at all** → chatbot should refuse (“I only answer database-related questions”).

This is absolutely doable with Hugging Face models (LLaMA/Mistral/Falcon etc.) + a **retrieval pipeline**. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 How to Achieve This

You need **two layers of control**:

### **1. Domain Classifier (SQL/NoSQL vs. Not Domain)**

* A lightweight classifier (e.g., fine-tuned DistilBERT, or scikit-learn TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) to detect if the query is about databases.
* If NOT database → return a refusal immediately.

---

### **2. RAG Retrieval + Fallback**

* Query goes to **vector database** (FAISS/Pinecone) with your 10k rows.
* Two possible scenarios:
  **(a) Good matches found** → return retrieved rows + user query → pass into LLaMA.
  **(b) No good matches found** → skip retrieval and just let LLaMA answer from its pre-trained knowledge **but with guardrails**.

To detect “good matches,” you set a **similarity threshold**.
Example: cosine similarity < 0.6 → assume dataset has no answer.

---

### **3. Guardrails Against Hallucination**

Even if you let LLaMA answer directly, you want to **minimize hallucination**. You can do this with:

* **System Prompting**:

  ```
  You are a database expert. You only answer questions about SQL/NoSQL databases. 
  If the question is outside this domain, say "I only answer database-related queries."
  If the answer is not in the provided context but still in your knowledge of SQL/NoSQL, give the correct answer concisely.
  Do not invent information.
  ```
* **Answer Verification**: Use a post-checker model (like GPT-3.5 turbo or even smaller models) to verify “Does this answer look domain-relevant and factual?”

---

## 🔹 Using Hugging Face Models

Yes ✅, you can absolutely achieve this with Hugging Face APIs:

### Example Pipeline:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss

# Load embedding model
embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Load LLaMA or Mistral (Hugging Face)
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")
llm = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Build FAISS index
docs = [...]  # your 10k rows
doc_embeddings = embedder.encode(docs, convert_to_numpy=True)
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(doc_embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(doc_embeddings)

def chatbot(query):
    # Step 1: Check domain relevance
    if not is_database_query(query):  
        return "I only answer database-related queries."

    # Step 2: Retrieve relevant docs
    q_embedding = embedder.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)
    D, I = index.search(q_embedding, k=3)
    
    # Check similarity threshold
    if D[0][0] < 0.6:  
        context = ""  # fallback, dataset has no answer
    else:
        context = "\n".join([docs[i] for i in I[0]])

    # Step 3: Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
    You are a SQL/NoSQL expert.
    Context (if any): {context}
    Question: {query}

    Instructions:
    - If context is provided, answer ONLY from it.
    - If context is empty but question is still about SQL/NoSQL, answer from your knowledge.
    - If not related to databases, say "I only answer database-related queries."
    """

    response = llm(prompt, max_new_tokens=300, do_sample=True)[0]['generated_text']
    return response
```

---

## 🔹 Key Notes

* Hugging Face models like **LLaMA 2-7B-chat**, **Mistral-7B**, or **Falcon-Instruct** are strong for this.
* If you want a smaller but very reliable one, try **microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct** (fast and accurate).
* To reduce hallucinations further, you can chain in **Guardrails AI (RAGFilter)** or use **LangChain’s LLMChecker**.

---

✅ With this setup:

* If user asks: *“What is SQL normalization?”* → LLaMA answers (dataset fallback if relevant).
* If user asks: *“What’s the weather in Karachi?”* → chatbot rejects.
* If user asks: *“What is CAP theorem?”* (database but not in dataset) → LLaMA answers from its pre-trained knowledge.

---

Do you want me to **extend this into a step-by-step implementation guide** (with code + tools like FAISS + Hugging Face + classifier), so you can build the full prototype locally?

# ___________________________________________________________________________

# Prompt 2

Perfect 👍 since you already have **11,000 rows** in `jsonl` with `{"prompt": "...", "completion": "..."}` format, you’re in a really good position. Let’s walk through **next steps** to implement the full chatbot pipeline (RAG + fallback to LLaMA knowledge):

---

# 🔹 Step 1: Clarify Use of Dataset

* Your dataset looks like a **Q\&A style corpus**.
* Each row:

  ```json
  {"prompt": "What is SQL normalization?", "completion": "Normalization is ..."}
  ```
* This means you can use it for **retrieval** or **fine-tuning**.
* Since you picked **Option 1 (RAG)**, we’ll use it as a **knowledge base** for retrieval.

---

# 🔹 Step 2: Preprocess Dataset

* Load the JSONL file into Python.
* Extract `prompt` + `completion`.
* Create a **knowledge document** for each row (combine Q\&A).

```python
import json

docs = []
with open("data.jsonl", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        row = json.loads(line)
        text = f"Q: {row['prompt']}\nA: {row['completion']}"
        docs.append(text)

print(len(docs))  # should be 11000
```

---

# 🔹 Step 3: Build Embedding Index (FAISS)

* Use `sentence-transformers` for embeddings.
* Store embeddings in **FAISS** index.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  # lightweight & fast

doc_embeddings = embedder.encode(docs, convert_to_numpy=True, show_progress_bar=True)

# Build FAISS index
dimension = doc_embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(doc_embeddings)

print("Index size:", index.ntotal)  # should be 11000
```

---

# 🔹 Step 4: Load LLaMA (Hugging Face)

You’ll need a **chat-tuned model** for safe responses.

Examples:

* `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` (needs Hugging Face token + GPU).
* Or lighter `microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` (CPU-friendly, less hallucination).

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline

model_name = "microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"  # or llama2-chat if you have GPU
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")

llm = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

---

# 🔹 Step 5: Domain Classifier (Optional but Recommended)

Train a **binary classifier** (Database-related vs Not).

* Fast way: fine-tune `distilbert-base-uncased` on small labeled dataset of DB vs non-DB queries.
* Quick hack: keyword-based filter (detect terms like SQL, NoSQL, database, query, etc.).

```python
def is_database_query(query: str) -> bool:
    keywords = ["sql", "nosql", "database", "query", "table", "index", "join"]
    return any(k in query.lower() for k in keywords)
```

---

# 🔹 Step 6: Retrieval + Fallback Pipeline

Now combine everything:

```python
def chatbot(query):
    # Step 1: Check domain relevance
    if not is_database_query(query):
        return "I only answer database-related queries."
    
    # Step 2: Retrieve top matches
    q_embedding = embedder.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)
    D, I = index.search(q_embedding, k=3)  # top 3
    
    # Step 3: Check threshold
    if D[0][0] > 0.6:  
        # High similarity, use dataset
        context = "\n".join([docs[i] for i in I[0]])
    else:
        # No good dataset match → fallback to model
        context = ""
    
    # Step 4: Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
    You are a SQL/NoSQL expert.
    Context: {context if context else "No context found."}
    Question: {query}

    Instructions:
    - If context is provided, answer only from it.
    - If no context, but question is still about databases, answer from your own knowledge.
    - If not database related, say: "I only answer database-related queries."
    """

    response = llm(prompt, max_new_tokens=300, do_sample=True)[0]['generated_text']
    return response
```

---

# 🔹 Step 7: Test the Chatbot

* **Case 1**: Query in dataset → it should retrieve & answer from docs.
* **Case 2**: Query not in dataset but still domain → fallback to model knowledge.
* **Case 3**: Query outside domain → reject.

---

# 🔹 Step 8: (Optional Enhancements)

* **Guardrails**: Use `GuardrailsAI` or `LangChain` to check hallucination.
* **API Deployment**: Wrap in **FastAPI / Flask** → expose as REST API.
* **UI**: Streamlit or React front-end.
* **Caching**: Use Redis for repeated queries.

---

✅ After this, you’ll have a **working chatbot specialized in SQL/NoSQL** with:

* Knowledge retrieval from your dataset.
* Fallback to LLaMA when dataset is missing info.
* Domain filter to refuse unrelated queries.

---

Do you want me to **extend this into a full working notebook/script** (with `requirements.txt` and FastAPI endpoint), so you can run it directly and test the chatbot?
