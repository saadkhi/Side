# Prompt 1

Got it ✅ — you want **Option 1 (RAG with LLaMA)** but with a twist:

* If the question is **domain-related (SQL/NoSQL)** and answerable from your 10k-row dataset → chatbot should pull from dataset.
* If the question is **domain-related but not covered in dataset** → chatbot should still answer using its **base LLaMA knowledge** (without hallucination).
* If the question is **not domain-related at all** → chatbot should refuse (“I only answer database-related questions”).

This is absolutely doable with Hugging Face models (LLaMA/Mistral/Falcon etc.) + a **retrieval pipeline**. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 How to Achieve This

You need **two layers of control**:

### **1. Domain Classifier (SQL/NoSQL vs. Not Domain)**

* A lightweight classifier (e.g., fine-tuned DistilBERT, or scikit-learn TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) to detect if the query is about databases.
* If NOT database → return a refusal immediately.

---

### **2. RAG Retrieval + Fallback**

* Query goes to **vector database** (FAISS/Pinecone) with your 10k rows.
* Two possible scenarios:
  **(a) Good matches found** → return retrieved rows + user query → pass into LLaMA.
  **(b) No good matches found** → skip retrieval and just let LLaMA answer from its pre-trained knowledge **but with guardrails**.

To detect “good matches,” you set a **similarity threshold**.
Example: cosine similarity < 0.6 → assume dataset has no answer.

---

### **3. Guardrails Against Hallucination**

Even if you let LLaMA answer directly, you want to **minimize hallucination**. You can do this with:

* **System Prompting**:

  ```
  You are a database expert. You only answer questions about SQL/NoSQL databases. 
  If the question is outside this domain, say "I only answer database-related queries."
  If the answer is not in the provided context but still in your knowledge of SQL/NoSQL, give the correct answer concisely.
  Do not invent information.
  ```
* **Answer Verification**: Use a post-checker model (like GPT-3.5 turbo or even smaller models) to verify “Does this answer look domain-relevant and factual?”

---

## 🔹 Using Hugging Face Models

Yes ✅, you can absolutely achieve this with Hugging Face APIs:

### Example Pipeline:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss

# Load embedding model
embedder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Load LLaMA or Mistral (Hugging Face)
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto")
llm = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Build FAISS index
docs = [...]  # your 10k rows
doc_embeddings = embedder.encode(docs, convert_to_numpy=True)
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(doc_embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(doc_embeddings)

def chatbot(query):
    # Step 1: Check domain relevance
    if not is_database_query(query):  
        return "I only answer database-related queries."

    # Step 2: Retrieve relevant docs
    q_embedding = embedder.encode([query], convert_to_numpy=True)
    D, I = index.search(q_embedding, k=3)
    
    # Check similarity threshold
    if D[0][0] < 0.6:  
        context = ""  # fallback, dataset has no answer
    else:
        context = "\n".join([docs[i] for i in I[0]])

    # Step 3: Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
    You are a SQL/NoSQL expert.
    Context (if any): {context}
    Question: {query}

    Instructions:
    - If context is provided, answer ONLY from it.
    - If context is empty but question is still about SQL/NoSQL, answer from your knowledge.
    - If not related to databases, say "I only answer database-related queries."
    """

    response = llm(prompt, max_new_tokens=300, do_sample=True)[0]['generated_text']
    return response
```

## 🔹 Key Notes

* Hugging Face models like **LLaMA 2-7B-chat**, **Mistral-7B**, or **Falcon-Instruct** are strong for this.
* If you want a smaller but very reliable one, try **microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct** (fast and accurate).
* To reduce hallucinations further, you can chain in **Guardrails AI (RAGFilter)** or use **LangChain’s LLMChecker**.

---

✅ With this setup:

* If user asks: *“What is SQL normalization?”* → LLaMA answers (dataset fallback if relevant).
* If user asks: *“What’s the weather in Karachi?”* → chatbot rejects.
* If user asks: *“What is CAP theorem?”* (database but not in dataset) → LLaMA answers from its pre-trained knowledge.

Do you want me to **extend this into a step-by-step implementation guide** (with code + tools like FAISS + Hugging Face + classifier), so you can build the full prototype locally?
